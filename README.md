# Citi Bike Data

An app that allows you to see where citi bike trips are taken from/to each month.


### Setup

- You will need a mapbox API key and set an ENV var

### Current status

- Wrote simple python scripts to extract data from citibike published CSVs and convert to files containing total end-destination trips. 
- Simple frontend setup that prints that data when the user clicks on a marker.
